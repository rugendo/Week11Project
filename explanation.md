# Creating Tickets on Zoho using RPA
### The projects involves using the Attended Automation Template on RPA to create customer care auto-ticketing system.

## In the project, I have used Uipath version 2021, this was so because version 2023 was not matching with version used for assignment on canvas.

## For one to be able to run the project, you must first create Zoha account from which the ticket will be created. Then the excel saved in the documentation since this is where the new details will be stored.
